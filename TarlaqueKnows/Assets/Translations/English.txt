TarlacHistory1,In Tarlac, you can find a blend of cultures, with Pangasinense culture to the north, Ilocano influence from Nueva Ecija to the east, Tagalog from Zambales to the west, and finally, Kapampangan from the south.
TarlacHistory2,There are stories and legends about the origin of the name Tarlac. The most well-known tale traces it back to the Aeta word Malatarlak, which refers to the coarse cogon grass that surprised the Aeta people when they first walked the land that would become Tarlac. The Aeta were the earliest inhabitants of Luzon, leading a nomadic lifestyle in search of food.
TarlacHistory3,The land of Tarlac was formed when volcanic eruptions created the Zambales Range. Initially, this part of the Zambales Range was an island separated from the rest of Luzon by a strait between Lingayen Gulf and Manila Bay. Due to ongoing volcanic activity, sand gradually accumulated on the Zambales Range above the sea's surface. This gave rise to the Province of Tarlac, a vast flat land that is part of the expansive plains of Luzon. Some of these extensive plains turned into lakes where canoes sailed during the rainy season from Manila Bay to Lingayen Gulf.
TarlacHistory4,Despite these plains having formed millions of years ago, Tarlac is a relatively young province in historical terms. It was the last province to be organized under Spanish rule in Central Luzon, and until 1874, it was part of Pangasinan and Pampanga.
TarlacHistory5,Nevertheless, the province granted itself one of the eight rays of the sun on the Philippine flag, symbolizing the first provinces to revolt against Spain in 1896. Tarlac is historic for its role in the country's struggle for independence. In March 1899, it was declared a seat of power by the First Philippine Republic under its first President, General Emilio Aguinaldo, when he fled from the former capital, Malolos, Bulacan. However, this only lasted for a month before he was pursued by the Americans to Nueva Ecija. In November 1899, it fell into American hands.
TarlacHistory6,During World War II, Camp O'Donell in Capas became synonymous with the Bataan Death March, where Filipino and American soldiers surrendered to the Japanese in 1942. It didn't regain its freedom until 1945 when military forces liberated Camp O'Donell and rescued the prisoners of war in Capas.
TarlacHistory7,In the decades that followed, the province experienced significant development, making it one of the progressive provinces in Central Luzon. The brief and straightforward account of Tarlac's colorful history is far from complete. It endured various challenges throughout its history, including earthquakes, cholera, epidemics, major fires, severe floods, and other calamities. Tarlac continues to write its history.
TarlacHistory8,Over the years, Tarlac has proven its ability to overcome wars, economic challenges, political shifts, and more, as it continually emerges as a stronger and more beautiful Tarlac, ready to face the challenges of the future.
AnaoH1,Anao is the smallest town in terms of land area and has a long history, being organized as a municipality on March 16, 1870. However, its history predates this municipal status. The area that now comprises Anao was originally part of Pangasinan but was later incorporated into the Province of Tarlac during the Spanish rule in the early 1800s. At that time, the land was mostly uninhabited, with creeks and lush vegetation, including balete trees, lining the creek banks. The first settlers, migrating southward from the Ilocos Region, are believed to have come from Paoay, a municipality in Ilocos Norte. They settled along the creek banks and began clearing the land for agriculture, attracting more people from the north to settle in the area.
AnaoH2,As Anao's population and physical area grew over the years, the residents submitted a petition in 1870 for their barangay to be converted into a municipality, which was approved. However, during the revolution, the municipality faced challenges in maintaining its status, leading to another petition for reversion to a barangay of Paniqui, which was also approved. In 1899, Anao regained its municipal status for the second time and became a 7th class municipality.
AnaoH3,There are various accounts regarding the origin of Anao's name. One explanation suggests it comes from the Pangasinan word danao, meaning pond, lagoon, or shallow water. Some residents believe it is derived from anaoang, a native boiler used for cooking sugarcane juice into sugar. Perhaps the most popular version of the town's name is that it comes from anahaw, a type of palm tree that was abundant in the area during its early history.
AnaoH4,Despite being the smallest in population and land area, Anao is classified as one of the fifth class municipalities in the Province of Tarlac.
BambanH1,The municipality of Bamban, established during the Spanish regime, was originally founded out of a vast jungle inhabited by mixed settlers comprising the aborigines or Negritos, the Lambal Aetas, and Christian native immigrants from Pampanga and the Tagalog provinces. As early as 1700, the Agustinian Missionaries from Mabalacat, Pampanga came to spread the Roman Catholic faith and later to civilize the natives.
BambanH2,On August 16, 1876, the ecclesiastical authorities officially established the Mission de Pueblos. The Augustinian Recollects or Orden Recoletos de San Agustin was in charge of the Mission. The Missionaries received support from the Spanish Government, and in 1800, the Mission or Settlement received official recognition from the Spanish Government and was named the town Bamban, which was derived from an aquatic plant found abundant in the fertile valleys. Bamban was originally part of Pampanga, with Villa de Bacolor as its capital. However, with the creation of the Province of Tarlac in 1894, Bamban was separated from its mother province of Pampanga and became part of Tarlac province.
BambanH3,Bamban played a historical role during the Filipino-Spanish and later the Filipino-American revolutions when, on June 6, 1899, it was proclaimed the revolutionary capital of the Philippines by Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo. In recognition of this historical event, the local legislative body, the Sangguniang Bayan, passed Special Ordinance No. 1, series of 1999, declaring June 6 as Bamban Day.
CamillingH1,On the western reaches of Tarlac Province lies the historic town of Camiling. Early in the eighteenth century, this thriving community was a sitio of Paniqui, contrary to the popular belief that it was a a part of Bayambang, Pangasinan. The discovery of a Spanish document in 1937 attested to the fact that it really belonged to Paniqui. Further evidence shows that in the same document, it was stated that the inhabitants of Camiling paid their tributes to Paniqui. In the beginning, the community was a vast area of cogon growth interposed with thick forestalls areas stretching far as the Zambales mountain ranges. A wide river cut peacefully through it.
CamillingH2,The early inhabitants of the place were known as  Aetas  who depended as for their living on fruit trees and by hunting and fishing. With the coming of the Pangasinenses and lIocanos from the north ,the  Aetas  who used to roam freely in the wilderness obliged themselves to move in to the interior. The new settlers first occupied the swampy land, now known as  Cacamilingan  on the opposite side of the river. With the passage of time, these settlers moved to the opposite shore considering that most often, disastrous floods were visiting the present site. To this new location, the residents therein built a little church or  visita  with the villagers taking  ST. MICHAEL  as the Patron Saint.
CamillingH3,The town Camiling owes its name after the name of a tree called  CAMIRING  which grew abundantly in the wilderness. The letter  R  in  CAMIRING  was changed to  L  for its liquid sound. As this settlement attained progress, CAMILlNG became a District Commission from 1834-1837. It was founded by Don Francisco Soriano, an adventurous barangay leader who incidentally became the town s first District Commissioner, followed by Domingo Claudio, Bernabe Bugarin and Pascual Cabacungan.
CamillingH4,In 1838, Camiling became an independent town, formally separated from the mother town of Paniqui and with Don Vicente Galsim as the first Governadorcillo. Thirty-eight (38) others followed him. Don Buenaventura Torres was the last to serve under the Spanish regime and the first Presidente Municipal under the Revolutionary Government by Aguinaldo. Of historical importance, the Camiling Catholic Convent was the death place of Gen. Pedro Pedroche and his men for being accused as rebels.
CamillingH5,CAMILlNG is a first class municipality in the western part of the province of Tarlac in the Philippines. It is about 150 kilometers north-northwest of Manila, and about 50 kilometers south-southwest of Dagupan City in Pangasinan. It is the commercial center of an area composed of about eight (8) towns, and borders the Province of Pangasinan. It is the gateway to central and western Pangasinan through the Romulo Highway (formerly Highway 13). It borders San Clemente on the west, Bayambang from the north, Sta. Ignacia and Mayantoc to the south and Paniqui by the east.
CapasH1,Created in 1710, Capas is among the oldest towns of Tarlac together with Bamban (1710), Paniqui (1574) and Tarlac (1686). Its creation was justified by numerous settlements which were already established in the river banks of Cutcut River since the advent of the eighteenth century. The settlements belonged to the domain of Pagbatuan and Gudya; two sitios united by Capitan Mariano Capiendo when he founded the municipality. Historical records suggest three versions on how Capas got its name. The first version, as told, was originated from capas-capas, the  edible flower  similar to that of the caturay or the melaguas that abundantly grew along the Cutcut river banks. The second version, accordingly, was adapted from a  cotton tree  called capas, in Aeta dialect. The third version suggested that it was derived from the first three letters of the surnames of the town s early settlers, namely: Capitulo, Capitly, Capiendo, Capuno, Caponga, Capingian, Caparas, Capera, Capunpue, Capit, Capil, Capunfuerza, Capunpun, Caputol, Capul and Capan. Assertively, they were called  caps  or  capas  in the local language.
CapasH2,Between 1946-1951, registered barangays of Capas were Lawy, O Donnell, Aranguren, Sto. Domingo, Talaga, Sta. Lucia, Bueno, Sta. Juliana, Sampucao, Calingcuan, Dolores and Manga, which were the 12 barrios during Late President Elpidio Quirino issued the Executive Order No. 486 providing  for the collection and compilation of historical data regarding barrios, towns, cities and provinces.  Today, Capas constitutes 20 barangays including all 12 except Calingcuan was changed to Estrada, Sampucao to Maruglu, Sto. Domingo was divided in two and barangays such as Sta. Rita, Sto. Rosario, Cristo Rey, Cubcub, Cutcut I & II, and Talaga were added.
ConcepcionH1,In 1860, the towns of Concepcion and Magalang comprised a single town named San Bartolome (presently a barangay of Concepcion), which was a military Commandancia of Pampanga under the Spanish regime.
ConcepcionH2,A catastrophic flood devastated the whole settlement of San Bartolome in 1863 and its residents were left with no other choice but to abandon the place. Divided as to where they were to resettle, some went north and others went south.
ConcepcionH3,The first group, headed by Don Pablo Luciano, the Governadorcillo, organized a new settlement on the slopes of Mt. Arayat further south and named the settlement after him. Eventually, the place was renamed Magalang.
ConcepcionH4,The second group who took refuge in the north comprised the Santoses, Laxamanas, Salvadors, Yumuls, Castros, Dizons, Pinedas, Felicianos, Aquinos, Corteses, Bermudezes, Perezes, Punsalangs and many others, and settled in a place (now called Santo Nino) then occupied by the Lindos and the Amuraos (Don Esquolastiquo Amurao and Don Gaston Amurao).
ConcepcionH5,Most of the settlers became dissatisfied with the place, as it abounded with snakes and was scarce in water. They moved further south to a place now known as Concepcion. The settlers began clearing the land and built huts and roads. After several years, they named the place Concepcion after the Immaculate Conception, who was believed to possess power over the snakes that abound in the area.
GeronaH1,The history of the Municipality of Gerona can be traced back to the reign of the Spaniards when the Dominican Missionaries in the Philippines started to propagate the Catholic faith in the whole archipelago in 1704. The Dominicans placed the Vicar of Malanguey (now Bayambang, Pangasinan) is charged with the mission of converting the local inhabitants of  Paontalon  (original name of Gerona) to become Catholics. In 1722, Paontalon was recognized as a small village and became part of the Municipality of Paniqui then under the Province of Pangasinan.
GeronaH2,In the early part of the nineteenth century, the inhabitants of Paontalon started to flourish due to the migration of people from the Northern Provinces of Luzon in search of greater opportunities. It is believed that the first group of people who came and settled in Gerona are the Ilocanos and Pangasinenses.
GeronaH3,The people settled on the hill by the skirt of a little forest that the Pangasinan folks named  Barug  meaning little forest or  Pugo  in Ilocano. It is believed that Barug was adopted as the name of the newfound settlement due to the fact that the Pangasinense outnumbered the Ilocanos.
GeronaH4,In 1765, the name Barug was officially changed to Gerona in honor of the Spanish Governor-General Narciso Claveria, who hails from Girona, Spain. Girona is a city in northern Catalonia, Spain, at the confluence of the Ter, Onyar, Galligants, and G ell rivers.
GeronaH5,It was not until the year 1844 when Gerona finally became an independent town but without a Gobernadorcillo. The Don Anacleyo Melegrito, the town s first Gobernadorcillo, was only appointed in 1845.
GeronaH6,When Tarlac Province was founded in 1873 by the Spanish Central Government, Gerona was one of the towns which were included in the new Province of Tarlac.
LapazH1,The early history of La Paz is told in a legend. Once upon a time there was an old, old pueblo called Cama Juan situated right along the bank of the Chico River bordering the province of Tarlac and Nueva Ecija. When the Chico River overflowed during a storm, a great flood swept the entire pueblo at an unholy hour when the entire populace was asleep. The flood left in its wake a picture of total devastation claiming scores of human life.
LapazH2,This forced the inhabitants of Cama Juan to evacuate the place and look for a better place to settle in. The old site (Cama Juan) is known as Balen Melakwan or Abandoned Town.
LapazH3,The inhabitants chose a field of evergreen grass and shubbery, which they named Matayumtayum. Hard work and determination enabled the town to prosper and in time peace and order reigned in the settlement.
LapazH4,Towards the end of the nineteenth century, Francisco Macabulos and Captain Mariano Ignacio selected a more centrally located site for the future town to be known as La Paz. But La Paz existed then only as a barrio of the town of Tarlac until 1892. When it was separated from the latter and rechristened in honor of its patron saint Nuestra Senora de La Paz y Buen Viaje. Its emergence as a new town gave its citizens a chance to run their own government with don Martin Aquino as the first Governadorcillo.
LapazH5,In due time, due to the heroic exploits of its own force La Paz was made first seat of the revolutionary government of the province of Tarlac during the Spanish regime with Gen. Francisco Makabulos as its first provincial governor.
MayantocH1,On the western part of Tarlac Province nestles the Municipality of Mayantoc. It is bounded on the west by the Zambales Mountain Ranges, on the south by the Municipality of San Jose, on the north by the towns of San Clemente and Camiling and on the west by Sta. Ignacia.
MayantocH2,In the dawn of history, what came to be known as Mayantoc today was once a densely forested area, peopled by a nomadic tribe, our brother Aetas. It was teeming with flora and fauna where a variety of a vine called  yantok  abounds. When settlers who were attracted by the beauty and rich natural resources came they referred to this place as  May Yontok . This is how the place got its name.
MayantocH3,Formerly, it was a barrio Camiling. The appointment of Gov. General Francis Burton Harrison, who believed in the increased Filipino participation in the government, and in the Enactment of the Jones Law otherwise known as the Philippine Autonomy Act, inspired the illiustrious leaders, Don Francisco P. Santos and Don Adriano Tolentino to campaign and petition for the conversion of Mayantoc into a town.
MayantocH4,As required for township, there must be a school, market, a church and a  presidencia . So, Don Francisco Pascual Santos and his wife Do a Ana Versoza donated parcels of lands for these purposes and attached these documents to their petition. It is today the site of the Mayantoc Elementary School, the town s public market, plaza and auditorium and the Roman Catholic Church. The house of Don Adriano Tolentino become the  presidencia .
MayantocH5,With the help of the Provincial Governor, Gov. Ernesto Gardiner, Rep. Luis Morales, House Speaker Sergio Osme a, Sr., Gov. Gen. Francis Burton Harrison created Executive Order No. 96 on December 1916 creating Mayantoc as the 16th town of Tarlac and was formally inaugurated on January 1,1917.
MayantocH6,The first appointed Municipal President was Antonio Sanz but was ousted by a petition filed by Don Antonio Malong, Don Miguel Celebrados and other Councilors due to aristocratic  Kastillan Ways . In an election held on the same year, Don Francisco P. Santos won and became the first elected Municipal President.
MayantocH7,From that time, 100 years since Don Francisco P.Santos led successfully the affairs and development of the newly created Municipality, a long line of well-meaning and well-intentioned individuals that best signify the Mayantocque an s capacity of greatness in public service and leadership have successfully and successively led the town in the march to progress.
MoncadaH1,In the early part of the year 1860, four family heads of barrio Magaspac, Gerona, Tarlac namely: Don Juan Sagun, Don Pedro Sapon, Don Victoriano Avillanosa and Don Agustin Germinal packed up their belongings and hurriedly left their homes together with their families. They have incurred the hatred of the Spanish curate of Gerona, Fr. Modesto Perez, who was feared for his irritable nature and fierce vindictiveness. They decided to evacuate Magaspac to escape from the ire of the curate.?
MoncadaH2,Travelling northward for days through primeval forests, the refugees went past the old town of Paniqui. Then they took a northwesterly course and ultimately reached Sitio Caarosipan, nestling amidst the vast wastelands and within sight of scenic Morong Creek. Here the sturdy pioneers decided to stay. They noted with great admiration and interest the verdant environment dotted here and there by a big and stately arosip trees, the luscious fruit of which fascinated birds which fed with gusto as they chirped and fluttered all day.
MoncadaH3,Not long after wards, the rainy season set in. After dreary days of intermittent rainfall, Sitio Caarosipan was inundated to the utter disappointment of the prospective residents. Undaunted by Mother Nature s challenge, they moved out for good and repaired to higher ground, this time hitting Sitio Payacan (now Barrio Capaoayan) four kilometers east of Caarosipan. Here they built better homes and made wider clearing for their work animals and domestic pets. Since then, they called Caarosipan, Barriodaan, a contraction of the Ilocano phrase  barrio nga daan . ?
MoncadaH4,Convinced of the fertility and favorable elevation of the surrounding terrain, the four family heads lost no time in enticing other probable settlers from Gerona and Paniqui to try their luck with them. Not long afterwards, uninvited immigrants from Pangasinan and the Ilocos provinces arrived in Payacan. Many of these immigrants came from Paoay, Ilocos Norte hence, the present name of Barrio Capaoayan. Within a period of two years, the population of the settlement rose to sixty-four families. The municipal authorities of Paniqui, of which Payacan was then a part, thought of converting the sitio into a barrio. When this plan was finally realized, they selected Don Antonio Longa as teniente del barrio. He held the position up to 1862.
MoncadaH5,As San Ramon showed signs of advancement and progress, a Christian Chinese who was a merchant by calling, came to try his luck in the place. Through sheer industry and thrift, he soon emerged as the most prosperous and pivotal entity in the barrio. His influence among the residents gained headway with his material prosperity. He stirred the interest and  imagination of civic-minded citiizens to work with him for the conversion of San Ramon into an independent Municipality. Misfortune befell the entire scheme when the amiable Chinese died without realizing his pet dream. Nevertheless, the spirit of the movement did not perish with him. He ha an adopted son with the Christian name of Vicente Tintiangco who as also a full-blooded Chinese. As was the ante-mortem request of his dead benefactor, Don Vicente pursued with equal vigor and determination the succeeding phase of the undertaking.?
MoncadaH6,Through his persistent machination, he succeeded in having San Ramon into a full-fledged municipality by virtue of a proclamation by the Spanish Military General of Tarlac province, Don Julian Ocon. This very historic event took place on July 1, 1875. The infant municipality was named MONCADA in honor of a certain influential nobility in Spain. The first town executive of Moncada was Don Sinforoso Marquez who rendered service from 1875-1877. As such, his title was Governadorcillo y Juez Local Ex-Officio.
MoncadaH7,In recognition of his meritorious service and sacrifices for the commoner, Don Vicente Tintiangco was posthumously awarded the diploma of honor and a medal of merit by the GOVERNADOR Y CAPITAN GENERAL DE FILIPINAS, Don Joaquin Jovellar Y Soler in an elaborate ceremony on July 14, 1884. Don Fruto Tintiangco, one of the three sons of the Chinese founder of Moncada, stood to accept the much-deserved awards.
PaniquiH1,The birth of Paniqui could be traced way back in 1712 when the provincial government of Pangasinan sent a group of men south of Bayambang, Pangasinan for the expansion of the Christian Faith. The pioneering group was led by two brothers, Raymundo and Manuel Paragas of Dagupan and established the Local Government in a Sitio called  manggang marikit  (mango of an unmarried woman) now apart of Guimba, Nueva Ecija. Surprisingly, in this sitio, sere a great number of mammals called by Ilocanos  pampaniki  and it was from this term that the name Paniqui was derived.
PaniquiH2,An uprising led by Caragay during the early part of 1720 forced the Local Government in  manggang marikit  to abandon the place and to evacuate for lowland called Acocolao, a place two kilometers west of the present Poblacion. It was a historical sitio where the first Moro in the Philippines, Sultan Ali Mudin was baptized in 1750 and embraced Christianity.
PaniquiH3,Paniqui was a sprawling town that covered a wide area that time. Some of the barrios that formerly comprised Paniqui were  San Roque  now Cuyapo;  Barong  now Gerona;  San Jose De Camiling  now Camiling;  Bani  now Ramos;  San Ramon  now Moncada; and Anao.
PaniquiH4,The period between 1750 and 1896 were painful years of Spanish tyranny and oppression. Because of the insurrectos and sometimes bandits conveniently sprouted among the people that made sporadic attacks upon the Conquistadores. These attacks on the Spaniards, who came on the islands bringing the Sword and the Cross, were marred by cholera and smallpox epidemics punctuated by floods and typhoons.
PaniquiH5,However, a group of Paniqui patriots, welded together by a common consciousness of oneness, unselfish devotion for freedom and spurred by Spanish ruthless tyranny, organized a legitimate segment of the Katipunan on January 12, 1896 which is far cry from the bandits that used to harass the Spaniards.
PaniquiH6,These dauntless men made daring exploits, unrecorded in the history of the Katipunan, the most prominent of which was the ambuscade of Spanish soldiers along the road going to Anao and killing a great number of them. These incidents made a prelude to the end of the Spanish occupation in Paniqui. The advent of American occupation saw a happy transition from the almost aristocratic and enigmatic characteristic of Spanish conquistadores to the democratic way of life under American tutelage.
PaniquiH7,In Paniqui, the Japanese were confronted with an enemy which is mighty in its fury and relentless in its vengeance. The members of the Guerilla force under Col. Maristela and aiding local troops of the Philippine Commonwealth Army military units was dedicated their unflinching loyalty to the cherished ideals of their motherland the Philippines by establishing a security cordon of the people under the very nose of the Japanese. The Guerilla outfit preserved the landmarks of Paniqui like the sugar central, municipal building, public school buildings and practically all the unpretentious private homes. One of the bloodiest chapters of this guerilla outfit was recorded on May 8, 1945, when the Guerilla forces were annihilated two platoons of Japanese Soldiers at Sta. Ines where 52 sons of Nippon were killed. The arrival are came back of the local Filipino soldiers under the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary units turns to helping guerrillas are become the liberated the town during the war.
PaniquiH8,Today, the people of Paniqui, welded by the same persuasion that held them together during the most trying moments in history, are working again, hand in hand to make their native town, the progressive, respected, and thriving community that is.
PuraH1,It was during the Spanish regime when migrants coming from the Ilocos Region ( Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur and La Union) moved southward to look for arable lands. These early settlers were forced to abandon their place of birth because it consisted of narrow coastal plains and highlands where agriculture is not a promising means of livelihood. These migrants who were close relatives (brothers, and sisters, cousins, uncles and aunts) decided to stay on the northeastern part of a future province later known to be Tarlac. The place at that time was forest, and so the migrants took the plains of clearing the area preparatory for agricultural activities.
PuraH2,Because of kinship, they considered themselves pure Ilocano settlers of the place, and they unanimously agreed to dub their settlement  PURA.  It seems that the place where the settlers established their settlement was originally a part of Barrio de Villa, then a part of the Municipality of Gerona. The settlement gradually grew until the leaders felt that it was ripe for township and filed a petition to the proper authorities to have the settlement converted to a town. In 1877, through the initiative and efforts of Fr. Pedro Graneta, then the parish priest of Gerona, Pura won and enjoyed its bid for political status as pueblo or town in 1877, by the virtue of Spanish laws.
PuraH3,However, Pura s recognition and political status as a town did not last long, for unknown reasons. The town was reverted into its original status as a barrio in 1903, again under the political jurisdiction of the Municipality of Gerona. Five years later or in 1908, Pura s township status was re-established with the late Don Felix Melegrito as its Chief Executive or president. In 1919, during the second term of Don Felix Melegrito, about 2,000 hectares of agricultural land at the eastern portion of Pura were ceded and became territorial parts of Guimba, Nueva Ecija, by virtue of a court decision establishing the territorial delineation separating the town of Pura, Tarlac, and Guimba, Nueva Ecija. These are now parts constituting the barangays of San Miguel, Medina, Maybobon, and Susubaen. Since then, the Municipality has sixteen (16) barangays. At present, the Municipal Leadership is under the reins of Hon. Concepcion A. Zarate, M.D.
RamosH1,The history of Ramos is intertwined with the migration of Ilocano settlers from Santa Narvacan, Batac during the mid-19th century. These settlers were drawn to the fertile plains in the area, which had abundant grasses and the presence of a tree known as Bani, which was believed to have medicinal properties. As these settlers established their community, they identified it with the medicinal Bani tree and officially named it Bani, becoming one of the barrios of the town of Paniqui.
RamosH2,The residents of Bani had long aspired to become an independent town. Paniqui, where their administration was based, was located seven kilometers away and was seen as too remote to effectively address the welfare of Bani. The villagers found it troublesome to travel long distances to transact business in the town hall of Paniqui, and they believed that their barrio was capable of running its own affairs.
RamosH3,During the Philippine Revolution, many residents of Bani responded to the call to arms, with notable figures like Don Bernabe Oteysa being chief local campaigners for the Katipunan Movement. The volunteers formed a group under the command of Commandante Alejandro Tolongan of Pura, with their headquarters at Sitio Bangkag under District No. 5. They were sent as reinforcements to various areas, including Balintawak, Calumpit, Tarlac, and Dagupan.
RamosH4,When the American administration was established, Don Alfonso Ramos was appointed as Tarlac's first Provincial Governor. Barrio leaders in Bani, including Carlos Filieu, Vicente Mauricio, and Magdalino Linsao, submitted a petition to the Provincial Board of Tarlac, requesting that their barrio be elevated to the status of a town. However, their initial request was denied due to missing required items. Subsequent petitions by the residents were also unsuccessful.
RamosH5,It was not until the second gubernatorial term of Don Manuel de Leon that Bani was formally designated as a town in 1919. The town was renamed Ramos in honor of their benefactor, Don Alfonso Ramos, who had initiated the town's establishment. Carlos Felieu, who had spearheaded the movement, became the town's first Presidente Municipal in 1921, with Pio Caba ero as Vice Presidente Municipal. Municipal Councilors included Nicasio Reginaldo, Francisco Ilingan, and Luis Aquino.
RamosH6,Among the early settlers in the area were the Mariano brothers (Vicente, Paulino, and Alfonso), Silverio Oteysa, Carlos Filieu, Valentin Nolasco, Paulino Baydin, Claro Caspe, Federico Balabat, Benidicto Mara on, and Maximo Mangabat, who became the first Cabesa de Barangay. Others like Maximo Ramos and Alejo Macaraeg settled in nearby areas, which later became known as Coral Iloco. Another group, led by Miguel Bacting, Joseph and Crisanto Tanduan, Baldomero Reguindin, Gavino Francisco, and Benidicto Mara on, settled in a location a kilometer away from Bani, which is now known as Toledo.
SanClementeH1,The town of San Clemente was created during the colonial period by virtue of a Royal Spanish Decree on November 14, 1876.
SanClementeH2,Story passed from one generation to another indicate that this town was so named as a bestowal of people s gratitude to the heroics of a figure who emerged with a sword in hand battle-ready sentinel at the approach of the bridge separating Tarlac from Pangasinan. This giant figure scared the advancing bandits that saw them scampering in different directions. Thus, foiling the sinister attempt of these bad elements from ransacking the town as it was their usual operation during the time. Upon witnesses  account, the man was later identified with high degree of certainty as Saint Clement of Rome.
SanClementeH3,The Philippines  cessation to the U.S. in 1898 relegated the town to a mere barangay of Camiling for reason of underdevelopment. Two years later, however, civil government was restored throughout the archipelago. The inhabitants of San Clemente led by Don Jacinto Dumlao, made representations with higher authorities to re-establish the  municipality  status of the town. This objective they later on achieved during the latter part of 1914 by virtue of Act No. 82 of the Philippine Commission upon the express orders from President McKinley of the United States of America.
SanClementeH4,Records indicate that the early settlers of this town, said to be the Dumlao, Trinidad, Loria, Espiritu, Martin, etc., were mostly of the Ilocano stock coming from the Ilocos Region in a quest for better economic opportunities in the abundantly fertile agricultural lands. These prominent people are indeed endowed with the vision to transform their adopted abode into a wholesome place to live. Thus, local governance has always been viewed at the socio-economic development perspective. The local chief executive position then did not only entail the laborious task of administration but also the shelling-out of sizable pecuniary contributions to pursue a project   up to the extent of donating tracks of land for public utilization. The public plaza, market, municipal building, school buildings, church, etc. are constructed on donated lands.
SanClementeH5,Structures in the locality reminiscent of the past era of colonization such as church, school buildings, houses, bridges, etc. have gradually given way to the modern day s engineering designs for relative purposes. The venerable tradition of the Filipino hospitality however, remained alive and in practice   where every visitor is genially accorded the honored guest treatment.
SanClementeH6,These days, the descendants of the early families still maintain their residency to perpetuate the legacy of productivity left by their ancestors. Consciously instilled, industry, which characterizes their Ilocano predecessors, is likewise evident. Through the years, the industrious townspeople toiled enough to realize the economic sufficiency everyone aims for. Modesty aside, modern day technological advances for domestic comforts are ubiquitous in majority of the households. While at the outset, the people rely mainly on farming as a source of livelihood; nowadays, local labor resources have gone their way overseas for better and more lucrative opportunities to improve their lot.
SanClementeH7,The municipality owes its growth mainly to the industry of its townspeople and to the public officials who took the cudgel one after another in the quest for prosperity. The election held in 1915 catapulted the first highest municipal official by the title, Presidente Municipal, the equivalent of Municipal Mayor in today s structure.
SanClementeH8,The birth of San Clemente as a town may be traced as far back when the locality was a mere sitio of the old town of Camiling, and when those early pioneers made use of the kaingin system in cleaning the land which was once covered with dense forest.
SanClementeH9,The region is situated on the foothill of Zambales mountains where bushes are plentiful. Historical records on file in the municipality of San Clemente show that the early settlers of this town were mostly of the Ilocano stock who have come from Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur, as adventurers in pursuit of fertile agricultural lands.
SanClementeH10,To this day, descendants of these early pioneers families still live enjoying the fruits of their labors and sacrifices of their ancestors like the Dumlao Clans, Martins and others.
SanClementeH11,Boundary Dispute: This long continuing boundary dispute between the Province of Tarlac and Pangasinan, where each desires not to give the fight over the contested land (2,474 hectares) sandwiched between the two interested towns of Mangatarem and San Clemente. Both parties are presenting strong evidences to support their claims. The conflict then was in the hands of Malaca an where His Excellency, the President of the Republic entrusted the boundary dispute case to a technical committee created by him under administrative Order No. 232, dated January 29, 1970.
SanManuelH1,San Manuel is a small town situated along the MacArthur Highway in the province of Tarlac, Philippines. It is located at the northernmost tip of Tarlac, bordering the province of Pangasinan. When viewed from an elevated perspective, the town's shape resembles that of a marquise, and it is often considered the crown of Tarlac due to its unique location.
SanManuelH2,The majority of the residents in San Manuel, like those in the northern part of Tarlac, have their roots in Ilocandia. This can be attributed to the Ilocano Diaspora, which refers to the historical tendency of Ilocanos to migrate in search of better opportunities. Other Ilocanos from neighboring Pangasinan moved southward, and some from Zambales moved eastward to settle in San Manuel. They were drawn to the area by the vast plains, abundant forests, rich waterways, and abundant wildlife. These hopeful settlers decided to make San Manuel their permanent home and established a thriving community.
SanManuelH3,San Manuel's origins can be traced to the period when it was known as a Sister Municipality of Moncada, Tarlac. This status was granted during the governorship of Don Manuel De Leon, in whose honor the town was named. Another account suggests that Victoriano Castro, an Ilocano migrant, played a significant role in petitioning the Tarlac government to declare their settlement as an independent town in 1909. This marked the beginning of San Manuel as a distinct and thriving municipality in the province of Tarlac.
SantaIgnaH1,Before the settlers from the Ilocos province, led by a man whose family was  Madriaga  set feed on the soil of Sta. Ignacia, the locality was a mere prairie. Together with his companions they settled in a place named  Binaga  which now called Nabagbagan-Nambalan. The place was so called  Binaca  in view of the fact that thousands of cattle were herded in that locality.
SantaIgnaH2,As time went on, more immigrants from Cabugao, Sarrat, Tagudin, Bacarra, Badoc, Candon and Paoay, all towns in the Ilocos regions arrived with all their personal belongings placed in their covered carts.
SantaIgnaH3,According to Treasurer Jose Pedroche, a local historian, those early pioneers employed the kaingin systems in clearing the lands, which was densely covered with cogon and talahib. Cattle raising and little agriculture were the early industries of the place. Later, the land area cultivated gradually increased simultaneously with the increased population.
SantaIgnaH4,With the locality progressing, Binaca in 1845 became a barrio of Camiling with Don Manuel Natividad, its first Teniente Basal. In 1875, the barrio became a town with Don Felipe Cabugasa, its Gobernadorcillo. It was in the same year when Binaca was changed to Sta. Ignacia in honor of her patron saint.
SantaIgnaH5,During the period of development, Binaca has been the target of a series of attack. In 1851, a great number of ruffians visited the place and carried away work animals and personal belongings. To harass the residents, they even went to the extent of harming whoever resisted. The inhabitants were nevertheless discouraged and instead worked harder to make up for their losses. In 1888, robbers forced their way in town and looted private properties including the  Timbre del Tribunal  (official seal) which was, however, recovered during the administration of Capitan Municipal, Don Vicente Laoang, somewhere around the year 1894.
SantaIgnaH6,One of the most significant events that occurred at a later period, which should never be forgotten in the town s history, was when General Pedro Pedroche and his men attack the town at the height of the town fiesta. In the encounter, the chief of police, a brother-in-law of General Pedroche and three policemen and a number of civilians were killed from bullet wounds. The tragic event arose when the chief of police refused the offer of Gen. Pedroche that he is his adviser.
SantaIgnaH7,In 1896, don Eulogio Madriaga, and then Capitan Municipal received an order from the parish priest of Camiling to move the town nearer the mother town of Camiling for security reasons. Don Eulogio Madriaga as subordinate official has no other alternative but to obey orders, hence the transfer of the town from Nambalan to its present site.
SantaIgnaH8,Around the year 1899. During the administration of Don Manuel Briones, Presidente Municipal, the local revolutionary government was inaugurated in Sta. Ignacia but no sooner than that erstwhile Philippine Republic fell in favor of the Americans and new administration under the United States began
SantaIgnaH9,One of the first steps undertaken by the new governing powers was the re-organization of the municipalities in the province. On recommendation of the Philippine Commission of 1902 it was held that smaller towns, which cannot stand by themselves, were to be reverted into barrios, the same to be attached to towns close to them. Thus, Sta. Ignacia along with Pura, San Clemente, Mayantoc, Mariones, O Donnel and Murcia ceased to exist as towns. For almost ten years, since 1903, Sta. Ignacia remained a barrio of Camiling.
SantaIgnaH10,The people of Sta. Ignacia were not at ease and they were restless. At least they agitated with aims to regain what lost in them. Under the initiative of Don Silvestre Lacuin, popularly known as Don Beting together with his co-workers in the persons of Don Eulogio Madriaga, Don Alipio Pascasio, Don Santiago Aviguetero, Don Florencio Antonio and the incumbent Teniente Basal, Don Simeon Hilario and backed up by the sympathy of the people for their movements they had sought all legal means to regain the status loss of their beloved town.
SantaIgnaH11,In due course, they had met so many drawbacks but were never discouraged in their fight for the common cause despite stiff opposition of the Camiling Municipal Council as influenced by the Camiling s great like Don Gregorio Romulo, Gregorio Clemente and Don Benson.
SantaIgnaH12,Due to insistent demand, the people of Sta. Ignacia at last sought the intervention of the Honorable Provincial Board of Tarlac and which by sheer good luck; the petition thus presented was finally considered favorable.
VictoriaH1,The establishment of Victoria as a community can be traced back to the mid-1800s during the expansion of the Spanish regime northward from Manila. This coincided with the formation of nearby towns like Porac and Floridablanca (now part of Pampanga) and Tarlac (now Tarlac City). In the mid-1800s, people began settling in the area around a swamp or wetland in search of a place with abundant food resources.
VictoriaH2,By 1849, houses and small communities had started to emerge in the vicinity of the wetland. The largest settlement was known as Namitinan, which later became part of the earliest barrio formed in 1852, called San Vicente de Canarum. This name was derived from the wetland known as Canarum Lake.
VictoriaH3,It wasn't until March 28, 1855, with the signing of a decree by Spanish Governor General Manuel Crespo, that the barrio of San Vicente de Canarum was separated from Tarlac to become an independent pueblo (town) named Victoria. The name Victoria was chosen to commemorate the victorious battle of the faithful followers of Queen Isabela II of Spain over their European enemies.
VictoriaH4,Today, remnants of Victoria's Spanish history can still be observed in the well-preserved municipal building, several old houses featuring Spanish architecture, and various structures that were constructed more than a century ago.
